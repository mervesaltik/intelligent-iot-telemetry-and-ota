## 🧠 Project Overview

This system collects telemetry data from IoT devices (CPU, memory, network, and power metrics) and uses a machine learning model to evaluate the impact of software updates. If an update enhances device performance and stability, it is approved. Otherwise, it is blocked. This intelligent OTA update mechanism increases system resilience and reduces update-induced failures.


## 🎯 Motivation

Traditional IoT update mechanisms often ignore real-time system data, which can lead to excessive CPU loads, memory leaks, or network congestion. This project aims to:
- Evaluate real-time performance metrics.
- Apply updates only if they improve or maintain performance.
- Create a smarter, adaptive, and failure-resistant IoT ecosystem.
